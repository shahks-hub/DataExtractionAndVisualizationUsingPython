# DataExtractionAndVisualizationUsingPython
\


This project uses a URL to a data file in JSON and extracts data from it.
The dataset contains Information about small businesses in the City of Hartford and extracts their names, 
street name and type of business.
Furthermore it stores them in the Sqlite database using SQL commands and counts any repeating trends to assess common types and areas,
any businesses that have repeated names. 
Some insights I gathered from this dataset: 
- small businesses with multiple brances
- areas where small businesses are popular 
- the kinds of sectors where small businesses are most common 

This method of analyzing data using Python can be applied to different datasets to efficiently visualize the trends.
